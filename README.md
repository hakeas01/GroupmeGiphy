# GroupMe Giphy Bot
Add a Giphy bot to your groupme chats!
This setup requires some prior knowledge of using Github and Heroku.

## Installation
* Prerequisites - You should have:
 * A Github account
 * A Heroku account
 * A Groupme account

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new Heroku app, using the 'Connect to Github' deployment method on Heroku. Select the repository you just forked.
3. Go to https://dev.groupme.com/session/new, login, and then go to https://dev.groupme.com/bots.
4. Create a new bot
  * Select the group that you want to add the bot to.
  * Name the bot whatever you like. It doesn't need to be called 'Giphy'.
  * Use https://[your_heroku_app_name].herokuapps.com/ as the 'callback url'
  * Add a link to a picture for your bots avatar, if you'd like.
  * Submit!
5. Go to your Heroku app's settings, and 'reveal config vars'
  * Add the key 'BOT_ID' with the corresponding value found from your bot you created at https://dev.groupme.com/bots.
  * Add the key 'GROUP_ID' with the corresponding value found from your bot you created at https://dev.groupme.com/bots.
  * If you'd like to make your bot Trump (optional), add the key 'TRUMP' with the value 'true'.
6. Go to 'Deploy' in your Heroku app, scroll to the bottom, and hit 'Deploy Branch'
7. You're done!

## Using the bot
All you need to do to use the bot is type '@giphy' or '@Giphy' anywhere in a message, and the bot will post the first Giphy link that it finds from what you type after your '@giphy'.

For example, if a user types: "Hey, @Giphy it's lit", then the bot will search giphy for "it's lit". At the time of writing this Readme, the bot will post the link "https://media.giphy.com/media/26ufcQNzm5YwuNxja/giphy.gif".

It's that simple!
